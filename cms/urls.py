"""
Custom URLs for serving Wagtail pages

NOTE:
These definitions are needed because we want to serve pages at URLs that match
edX course ids, and those edX course ids contain characters that do not match Wagtail's
expected URL pattern (https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/blob/a657a75/wagtail/core/urls.py)

Example: "course-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_Course" â€“ Wagtail's pattern does not match the ":" or
the "+" characters.

The pattern(s) defined here serve the same Wagtail view that the library-defined pattern serves.
