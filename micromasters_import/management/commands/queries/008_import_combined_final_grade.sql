----This script is to migrate the grades for course run from MicroMaster:
----  It computes score from FinalGrade and ProctoredExamGrade using formula - course run grade * 0.4 + exam grade * 0.6
----  grades need to exist in both FinalGrade (course run) and ProctoredExamGrade (exam)
----  grades need to be 'passed'
